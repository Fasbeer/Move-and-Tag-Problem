As part of the COMP205P module, all students, in groups, were required to design and implement algorithms capable of navigating a starting robot to wake up the other robots whilst at the same time avoiding obstacles. We were required to create a visualiser in order to represent those paths taken by the robots during the process by indicating the starting robot, the paths taken by the robots and how they avoided the obstacles.
